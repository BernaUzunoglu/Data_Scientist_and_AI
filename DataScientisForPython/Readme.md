# Python Programming for Data Science

I started with the basic data structures of Python, developed my skills in writing functions, and learned to use them effectively in data science processes. By thoroughly studying essential libraries like NumPy and Pandas, which are indispensable for data analysis and machine learning, I gained proficiency in using these tools in data processing, analysis, and model building.

Moreover, I leveraged Python's powerful functional programming features to build scalable and modular pipelines. By mastering comprehensions, data manipulation, and visualization techniques, I developed the capability to create practical and effective solutions for complex scenarios.

With the knowledge gained during this process, I can now approach data-driven problems more creatively and effectively.

## PROJECT: Rule-Based Classification for Estimating Potential Customer Revenue

### Business Problem
A gaming company wants to create level-based customer personas using certain demographic features and segment these personas to estimate how much new customers could potentially contribute to the company's revenue.

For example: How much could a 25-year-old male iOS user from Turkey potentially contribute?

### Dataset Story
The `Persona.csv` dataset includes information about the prices of products sold by an international gaming company and demographic information of the users who purchased these products. The dataset contains records from individual sales transactions, meaning the data is not deduplicated. In other words, a user with certain demographic characteristics may have made multiple purchases.

You can explore the dataset here: [persona.csv](https://github.com/BernaUzunoglu/Data_Scientist_and_AI/blob/main/DataScientisForPython/datasets/persona.csv).

### Project File
You can check out the project file for Rule-Based Classification for Estimating Potential Customer Revenue here: [kural_tabanli_siniflandirma.py](https://github.com/BernaUzunoglu/Data_Scientist_and_AI/blob/main/DataScientisForPython/kural_tabanli_siniflandirma.py).
