   Python Programming for Data Science

In this course, I developed my skills starting from Python's fundamental data structures, advancing to writing functions, and applying these skills effectively in data science processes. I gained in-depth knowledge of essential libraries like NumPy and Pandas, which are indispensable for data analysis and machine learning. I acquired the ability to utilize these tools efficiently in data processing, analysis, and model-building workflows.  

Additionally, I mastered Python's powerful functional programming features, enabling me to create scalable and modular pipelines. Through expertise in comprehensions, data manipulation, and visualization, I developed practical and effective solutions for complex scenarios.  

The knowledge I gained through this course has empowered me to approach data-driven problems with more creative and impactful solutions.

        Project: Estimating Potential Customer Revenue Using Rule-Based Classification      

    Problem Definition    :  
A gaming company wants to create level-based (persona) new customer definitions using some features of their customers. Based on these new customer definitions, the company aims to segment customers and predict the average revenue that potential new customers could generate.  

For example: The goal is to estimate the average revenue generated by a 25-year-old male user from Turkey who uses iOS.  

    Dataset Description    :  
The   persona.csv   dataset contains the prices of products sold by an international gaming company and some demographic information about the customers who purchased those products. Each record in the dataset represents a sales transaction, meaning the table is not deduplicated. In other words, a user with specific demographic characteristics may have made multiple purchases.  

You can explore the dataset [here](https://github.com/BernaUzunoglu/Data_Scientist_and_AI/blob/main/DataScientisForPython/datasets/persona.csv).  

To review the implementation of the Rule-Based Classification project, you can check the script [here](https://github.com/BernaUzunoglu/Data_Scientist_and_AI/blob/main/DataScientisForPython/kural_tabanli_siniflandirma.py).
