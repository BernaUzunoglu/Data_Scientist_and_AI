## ðŸŽ¯ Bootcamp Content  

The Bootcamp covers the following key modules:  

---

### 1. Python Programming for Data Science  

Starting with Python's basic data structures, I improved my function-writing skills and learned to use them effectively in data science processes. I explored libraries such as NumPy and Pandas, essential for data analysis and machine learning, and developed the ability to use these tools efficiently in data processing, analysis, and model-building workflows.  

Additionally, I leveraged Python's powerful functional programming features to create scalable and modular pipelines. By mastering comprehensions, data manipulation, and visualization techniques, I gained the ability to develop practical and effective solutions for complex scenarios.
